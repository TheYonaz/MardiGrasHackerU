                LaToya Cantrell (née Wilder; born April 3, 1972) is an American
                politician serving as the Mayor of New Orleans, Louisiana since
                May 7, 2018. A Democrat, Cantrell is the first woman to hold the
                office. Before becoming mayor, Cantrell represented District B
                on the New Orleans City Council from 2012–2018. Cantrell was
                born as LaToya Wilder in Los Angeles. She moved to New Orleans
                in 1990 to attend Xavier University of Louisiana, where she
                earned a BA in sociology.She attended an executive training
                program at the Harvard Kennedy School. Cantrell declared her
                candidacy for mayor of New Orleans in March 2017 in a race to
                replace term-limited mayor Mitch Landrieu. An open primary was
                held on October 14 and included 18 candidates. Cantrell garnered
                the most votes, winning 39% of the total. In the November 18
                runoff election, Cantrell defeated fellow Democratic opponent
                Desiree Charbonnet, a former municipal judge, with 60% of the
                vote. She is the first woman to lead New Orleans in its 300-year
                history, as well as the first mayor not born in the city since
                Vic Schiro.in 2016, Cantrell was given a lifetime achievement
                award by the presidents of Tulane, Loyola and Xavier
                universities and the University of New Orleans for her service
                to the community.

          <h1>Mardi Gras in New Orleans</h1>
          <p>
            The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in southern Louisiana,
            including the city of New Orleans. Celebrations are concentrated for
            about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day before
            Ash Wednesday (the start of lent in the Western Christian
            tradition). Mardi Gras is French for Fat Tuesday, but the season
            actually begins on King’s Day (12th Night, January 6th, and extends
            until midnight before Ash Wednesday. Club, or Krewe, balls start
            soon after, though most are extremely private, with their Kings and
            Queens coming from wealthy old families and their courts consisting
            of the season’s debutantes. Most of the high society Krewes do not
            stage parades. As Fat Tuesday gets nearer, the parades start in
            earnest. Usually there is one major parade each day (weather
            permitting); many days have several large parades. The largest and
            most elaborate parades take place the last five days of the Mardi
            Gras season. In the final week, many events occur throughout New
            Orleans and surrounding communities, including parades and balls
            (some of them masquerade balls). The parades in New Orleans are
            organized by social clubs known as krewes; most follow the same
            parade schedule and route each year. The earliest-established krewes
            were the Mistick Krewe of Comus, the earliest, Rex, the Knights of
            Momus and the Krewe of Proteus. Several modern "super krewes" are
            well known for holding large parades and events (often featuring
            celebrity guests), such as the Krewe of Endymion, the Krewe of
            Bacchus, as well as the Zulu Social Aid & Pleasure Club—a
            predominantly African American krewe. Float riders traditionally
            toss throws into the crowds. The most common throws are strings of
            colorful plastic beads, doubloons, decorated plastic "throw cups",
            and small inexpensive toys. Major krewes follow the same parade
            schedule and route each year. While many tourists center their
            Carnival season activities on Bourbon Street, major parades
            originate in the Uptown and Mid-City districts and follow a route
            along St. Charles Avenue and Canal Street, on the upriver side of
            the French Quarter. Walking parades - most notably the Krewe du
            Vieux and 'tit Rex - also take place downtown in the Faubourg
            Marigny and French Quarter in the weekends preceding Mardi Gras Day.
            Mardi Gras Day traditionally concludes with the "Meeting of the
            Courts" between Rex and Comus.

          <h1>Early history</h1>
          <p>
            The first record of Mardi Gras being celebrated in Louisiana was at
            the mouth of the Mississippi River in what is now lower Plaquemines
            Parish, Louisiana, on March 2, 1699. Iberville, Bienville, and their
            men celebrated it as part of an observance of Catholic practice. The
            date of the first celebration of the festivities in New Orleans is
            unknown. A 1730 account by Marc-Antoine Caillot celebrating with
            music and dance, masking and costuming (including
            cross-dressing).[2] An account from 1743 that the custom of Carnival
            balls was already established. Processions and wearing of masks in
            the streets on Mardi Gras took place. They were sometimes prohibited
            by law, and were quickly renewed whenever such restrictions were
            lifted or enforcement waned. In 1833, Bernard Xavier de Marigny de
            Mandeville, a rich plantation owner of French descent raised money
            to fund an official Mardi Gras celebration. James R. Creecy in his
            book Scenes in the South, and Other Miscellaneous Pieces describes
            New Orleans Mardi Gras in 1835.

          <h1>Effects of Hurricane Katrina</h1>
          <p>
            The devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina on August 29, 2005
            caused a few people to question the future of the city's Mardi Gras
            celebrations. Mayor Nagin, who was up for reelection in early 2006,
            tried to play this sentiment for electoral advantage[citation
            needed]. However, the economics of Carnival were, and are, too
            important to the city's revival. The city government, essentially
            bankrupt after Hurricane Katrina, pushed for a scaled back
            celebration to limit strains on city services. However, many krewes
            insisted that they wanted to and would be ready to parade, so
            negotiations between krewe leaders and city officials resulted in a
            compromise schedule. It was scaled back but less severely than
            originally suggested. 2006: A Knights of Chaos float satirizes the
            U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, responsible for the failed levees in
            New Orleans The 2006 New Orleans Carnival schedule included the
            Krewe du Vieux on its traditional route through Marigny and the
            French Quarter on February 11, the Saturday two weekends before
            Mardi Gras. There were several parades on Saturday, February 18, and
            Sunday the 19th a week before Mardi Gras. Parades followed daily
            from Thursday night through Mardi Gras. Other than Krewe du Vieux
            and two Westbank parades going through Algiers, all New Orleans
            parades were restricted to the Saint Charles Avenue Uptown to Canal
            Street route, a section of the city which escaped significant
            flooding. Some krewes unsuccessfully pushed to parade on their
            traditional Mid-City route, despite the severe flood damage suffered
            by that neighborhood. The city restricted how long parades could be
            on the street and how late at night they could end. National Guard
            troops assisted with crowd control for the first time since 1979.
            Louisiana State troopers also assisted, as they have many times in
            the past. Many floats had been partially submerged in floodwaters
            for weeks. While some krewes repaired and removed all traces of
            these effects, others incorporated flood lines and other damage into
            the designs of the floats. Most of the locals who worked on the
            floats and rode on them were significantly affected by the storm's
            aftermath. Many had lost most or all of their possessions, but
            enthusiasm for Carnival was even more intense as an affirmation of
            life. The themes of many costumes and floats had more barbed satire
            than usual, with commentary on the trials and tribulations of living
            in the devastated city. References included MREs, Katrina
            refrigerators and FEMA trailers, along with much mocking of the
            Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and local and national
            politicians. By the 2009 season, the Endymion parade had returned to
            the Mid-City route, and other Krewes expanding their parades Uptown.
